# WizJS
A Javascript rewrite of **[pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight)**
## Install
It's on its way to npm I promise!

## Usage

The main use case right now is by importing the library via *npm*. Whilst the main python library offers a CLI, **It is not planned for the Javascript rewrite**. It comes with much greater challenges and in my opinion it doesn't worth directing the main focus on a feature which is already done by default (for example.: **[Android WiZ App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tao.wiz&hl=US&gl=US)**).
